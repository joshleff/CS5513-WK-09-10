# Final Data-Driven Full-Stack App

In this assignment I extended the code from [this 
tutorial](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-create-todo-app-with-nextjs-firebase-383dcee65076)
to create a to-do app, adding tabs for events and  contacts with full **CRUD** support.
 Written in **Javascript**, it uses **Next.js**, **Chakra UI React** components,
**Google Firestore** database,
 and **Google Firebase** authentication.  It was deployed to **Vercel**.
